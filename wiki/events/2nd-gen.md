The **Framework [2nd Gen] Event** was a launch event held February 25, 2025 in San Francisco, California, during which Framework announced the [Framework Desktop](/products/framework-desktop), [Framework Laptop 12](/products/framework-laptop-12) and [Framework Laptop 13 (AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series)](/products/framework-laptop-13/ai-300-series).[^4] It is Framework's second ever launch event, after the [Framework Next Level Event](/events/next-level) in 2023. 

Members of the media and [Framework partners](/partners) received invitations to attend in-person, and a limited number of seats were available for community members who could arrange their own travel on an application basis.[^1] The event was also  livestreamed to Framework's YouTube channel.[^2]
