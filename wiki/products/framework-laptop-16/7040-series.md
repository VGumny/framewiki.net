# Framework Laptop 16 (AMD 7040 Series)
{% include sidecar.html %}
**Framework Laptop 16 (AMD 7040 Series)** is the first, and currently only generation of [Frameworkâ€™s](/framework-computer-inc) second product, [Framework Laptop 16](/products/framework-laptop-16), announced March 23, 2023 at the [Framework Next Level Event](/events/next-level).[^1] Pre-orders opened July 18 of the same year.[^2] The first laptops shipped in February, 2024.[^7]

It is available with AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and Ryzen 9 7940HS CPUs. Customers can optionally add an [AMD Radeon RX7700S GPU](/expansion-bay/radeon-rx-7700s), which connects via the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay).

### GPU
An AMD Radeon RX 7700S, featuring 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 100W TGP, and 2 Cooler Master fans, can be installed via the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay).

### Connectivity
#### Expansion Cards
Framework Laptop 16 supports USB 4 on ports 1 and 4, and USB 3.2 on all other ports. Ports 1, 2, 4 and 5 support 240W charging. Ports 1,2 and 4 support DisplayPort Alt Mode Plugging a USB-A expansion card into ports 1 and 4 may result in higher power consumption.[^8]

Framework Laptop 16 is not Thunderbolt certified, though many Thunderbolt devices and docks function when connected to a USB-4-compatible port.

#### Expansion Bay
The [expansion bay](/expansion-bay) connector includes power, DisplayPort and PCIe signaling.

#### Wireless
Framework Laptop 16 comes with the AMD RZ616 Wi-Fi Card, which supports WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2.[^5] [^6]

## Hardware Compatibility
### RAM
Framework Laptop 16 features two DDR5 SO-DIMM sockets. Framework offers their own [Framework-branded DDR5-5600](https://frame.work/marketplace/memory-storage?search=DDR5) modules in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB variants.[^3]

Standard DDR5 JEDEC (non-XMP) timings are supported. ECC is not supported.[^4]

### SSD
Framework Laptop 16 supports up to two NVMe SSDs -- one full-size M.2 2280, and another mini M.2 2230-sized drive stacked below the other.[^3] Framework Laptop 16 is the first Framework product to support more than one internal SSD.
## Known Issues
### Liquid Metal Pump Out
Early Framework Laptop 16 devices (serial numbers where the 11th, 12th and 13th digits are less than 444) used liquid metal thermal interface material, which may pump out of the CPU over time, degrading performance.[^11] To address the issue, Framework switched new production laptops (serial numbers where the 11th, 12th and 13th digits are greater than 444) to use Honeywell PTM7958 phase-change thermal interface paste. Owners of laptops with liquid metal can request a Honeywell PTM7950 thermal pad from Framework.[^12] Framework says the PTM7958 has "equivalently strong" performance to the original liquid metal.
