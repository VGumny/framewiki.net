# Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition
{% include sidecar.html %}

**Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition** was a variant of [Framework Laptop 13](/framework-laptop-13) developed in partnership with Google to run ChromeOS.[^1] It was announced September 21, 2022, with pre-orders opening the same day. Devices began shipping in December of that year.

The Chromebook was built on the Framework Laptop 13 chassis. The pre-built featured an Intel Core i5-1240P CPU, 8GB of DDR4-3200 and 256GB of storage. No DIY Edition was available.[^2] Framework did not release any subsequent generations before discontinuing the Chromebook line in August 2024. It will continue to receive software updates until at least 2030.[^1]

Framework posted a knowledgebase article on August 26, 2024 explaining how to convert a Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition to a Framework Laptop 13. The article includes an exception to the company's normal practice of not commenting on future plans by stating that they "donâ€™t currently have plans for a newer generation of Framework Laptop 13 Chromebook Edition." [^3]

## Differences From Framework Laptop 13
Chromebook Edition is built on the Framework Laptop 13 chassis with a version of [11th Gen Intel Core](/framework-laptop-13/11th-gen)'s stamped top case engraved with the Chromebook logo.[^7] Most Framework Laptop 13 parts are compatible, though separate Chromebook-specific part SKUs are also listed on the Marketplace.

Though the Chromebook mainboard uses the same CPU as the base model [Framework Laptop 13 12th Gen Intel Core](/framework-laptop-13/12th-gen), it uses a different mainboard that includes the Google Titan C security chip, which is necessary to run ChromeOS.[^1] [^4] The board is also the only Framework product to run mainline Coreboot, making it the only Framework product to run completely open-source firmware.[^5] All Framework Laptops use the ChromeOS project's open-source embedded controller firmware.[^6]

The device uses a different input cover with a ChromeOS-specific keyboard layout and different touchpad firmware that may have incompatibilities on Linux. The Chromebook's power button also lacks a fingerprint reader.
